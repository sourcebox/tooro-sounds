# About

This repository contains a collection of presets for the [Fred's Lab Töörö](https://fredslab.net/en/tooro-module.php) hardware synthesizer.

Feel free to use them in your own music in any way you like.

**Note:** some of the presets are used in the factory soundset that comes pre-installed with the unit. 

# Usage

Use a sysex utility to dump the .syx files to the device, e.g.:

- Windows: [MIDIOX](http://www.midiox.com/)
- macOS: [SysEx Librarian](https://www.snoize.com/sysexlibrarian/)
- Linux: [amidi](https://alsa.opensrc.org/Amidi)

Some DAWs are also capable of sending sysex messages.
